Q1: What is the difference between a merge and a rebase?

Answer: Git merge pulls in the latest changes from main into a feature branch or vice versa, 
creating a new merge commit in the process, and combining their merge histories. Git rebase
changes the base of a feature branch to the latest commit on main, giving a cleaner commit history.
Think of merging branches as tying a knot between two branches, and rebase as connecting the feature 
branch to the end of the main branch.
Q2: What is a remote repository?

Answer: Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on a server 
or another network, and often times this remote repository is accessible to other team 
members. This is in comparison to a local repository which is hosted on one's computer.
